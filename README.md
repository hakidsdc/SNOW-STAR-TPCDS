# STAR-SNOW-TPCDS
This repository contains:  The TPC-DS data generation scripts (star and snowflake versions), the script of creating the relational data warehouse (star and snowflake versions), the  script of graph-oriented NoSQL data warehouse creation (star and snowflake versions) and the TPC-DS queries that we used written in cypher query language.
# SNOW-TPCDS

# Relational
Please check the file SNOW_TPCDS_XGB_DATA_SCHEMA.sql to see the script that we used to transform the tpcds schema to a pure snowflake schema. 
Please check the file SNOW_TPCDS_XGB_RDW_Creation.sql to see the script that we used to create the tpcds snowflake relational data warehouses. 
please check the files req{3,7,13,19,27,28,42,48,52,55}_snow.sql to check the queries we used to evaluate the performance of the snowflake relational data warehouses. 
# Graph
Please check the file Snow_TPCDS_XGB_GDW_Creation.cql to see the script that we used to create the tpcds snowflake graph data warehouses. 
please check the files req{3,7,13,19,27,28,42,48,52,55}_snow.cql to check the queries we used to evaluate the performance of the snowflake graph data warehouses.
